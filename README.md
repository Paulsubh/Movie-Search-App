ðŸŽ¥ Movie Search Web Application

This project is a responsive web application that allows users to search for movies and retrieve detailed information such as the title, release date, genre, and plot. 
The application fetches data from an external movie API using JavaScript and dynamically displays the results on the page. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates the use of API integration, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles.
